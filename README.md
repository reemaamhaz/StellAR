# Tech Stack

StellAR has been built using React Native, ViroReact, Redux, Vectary, Adobe After Effects and Facebook's Spark AR Studio. 

 1.  **React Native** <br/>
 The core of StellAR is built using JavaScript in React Native. This framework was chosen to allow for possible deployment on both Android and iOS.
  
 2. **ViroReact** <br/>
 ViroReact integrates with React Native to facilitate full AR functionality. This includes plane recognition, object placement, interactivity with 3D objects and the facilitation of AR Portals. 
 
 3. **Redux** <br/>
 Redux was added to the project to best manage application state and navigation. 
 
 4. **Vectary** <br/>
 3D scenes and objects were built using Vectary's 3D Design and Modelling platform. Each was exported as an FBX file that was converted to Viro's own VRX format using the ViroFBX script.
 
 5. **Adobe After Effects** <br/>
 AR Portal scenes were built as 360-degree videos in Adobe After Effects. Space facts and learnings within each AR Portal were sourced from NASA's various digital resources. 
 
 6. **Spark AR** <br/>
Instagram and Facebook compatible AR Filters were built in JavaScript using Facebook's SparkAR Studio. These were designed as an AR aligned promotional gateway to the educational app.

# Our Team

StellAR began as a group project between six 2020 Harvard Summer School Students studying Agile Software Development: Morgan Hulsey (Scrum Master),  Lily Nguyen (Product Owner), Reema Amhaz (Dev), Nitya Pandeti (Dev), Bear Kruz (Dev), Polina Ibragimova (Dev). The concept of an AR education app was fully realised by Reema Amhaz (NYU Class of '21) and Bear Kruz (USYD Class of '22) in the 2 months following completion of the course. The original GitHub Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nbpandeti/the-sinister-six).

The StellAR App Icon was shot by Reema Amhaz in NYC on the 05/09/20 using her telescope!
